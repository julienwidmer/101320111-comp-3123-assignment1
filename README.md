## How to Log In
A user needs to be created and added into the database.
### Add a new user (if needed)
1. Copy the [User JSON object example](#examples-of-json-objects) or create yout own.
   1. The email address needs to be valid and unique (no duplicated users).
   2. The password needs to be strong and contain at least:
      1. 2 lowercase letters;
      2. 2 uppercase letters;
      3. 2 symbols;
      4. 2 digits;
      5. no spaces;
      6. at least 12 characters.
      
2. Open Postman and the request named **User - Sign Up**.
    *(POST request to http://localhost:8081/api/user/signup)*
3. Paste the JSON inside the body and send the request.
   *(Note: Passwords are encrypted.)*

### Log In with Username and Password
1. Open Postman and the request named **User - Log In**.
*(POST request to http://localhost:8081/api/user/login)*
2. Add the username and password inside a JSON object and send the request.

For example, if you created a user with our [JSON object example](#examples-of-json-objects), you would have the following in the body of your request:
```json
{
  "username": "jacobie",
  "password": "p4$5WOrd!*12"
}
```
